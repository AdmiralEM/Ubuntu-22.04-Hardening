Introduction to the Linux Hardening Learning Guide
Welcome to the Linux Hardening Learning Guide, a comprehensive resource designed for those who are keen on mastering the art and science of securing a Linux system. This guide is based on the robust principles outlined in the "CIS Ubuntu Linux 22.04 LTS Benchmark v1.0.0", and it aims to do more than just secure your Linux environment; it's here to deepen your understanding of Linux as a whole.

In the world of Linux system administration, there are numerous tools and technologies, like Ansible and similar automation platforms, that can harden a system almost instantaneously. These solutions are incredibly powerful and efficient, offering the ability to secure systems in a matter of minutes with minimal manual intervention. However, while they are highly effective, relying solely on such tools can leave a significant gap in one’s understanding of the underlying processes and principles.

This guide takes a different approach. Our goal here is not to provide the quickest route to a hardened system. Instead, we are focused on the journey of learning and exploration. By manually going through the hardening process, step by step, you will gain invaluable insights into the inner workings of Linux systems. This hands-on experience is crucial for anyone looking to not just secure their system but also to understand the 'why' and 'how' behind each action.

Each section of this guide corresponds to a specific aspect of the CIS Hardening Guide, broken down into digestible, easy-to-follow segments. We will explore the rationale behind each security recommendation, delve into the implications of various settings and configurations, and provide clear instructions on how to manually implement these changes.

By the end of this journey, you won’t just have a hardened Linux system; you’ll have a deeper appreciation and understanding of Linux. This knowledge is what sets apart competent system administrators and cybersecurity professionals.

Remember, the path to mastering Linux is not just about reaching the destination; it's about embracing the learning process along the way. Let's embark on this journey together and unlock the full potential of your Linux system, one manual step at a time.
